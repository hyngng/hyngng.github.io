- Static Typing
While JavaScript is dynamically typed, TypeScript allows you to add static typing to your code. This can help catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime, and can provide additional information to tools such as editors and linters.

- Interfaces
TypeScript includes support for interfaces, which allow you to define contracts for objects and functions. This can help improve code organization and maintainability, and can facilitate communication between different parts of a codebase.

- Type Annotations
TypeScript allows you to add type annotations to your code, which can provide additional information to developers and tools about the expected types of variables and functions.

- Decorators
TypeScript includes support for decorators, which allow you to add metadata and functionality to classes, methods, and properties. This can be useful for implementing features such as logging, validation, and performance monitoring.

- Readonly properties
TypeScript allows you to mark object properties as readonly, which prevents them from being modified after they are initialized. This can help improve code reliability and maintainability.

### JavaScript와의 차이점

- 변수 선언

  - TypeScript

  ```javascript
  function addNumbers(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }
  ```

  - JavaScript

  ```javascript
  function addNumbers(a, b){
  return a + b;
  }
  ```

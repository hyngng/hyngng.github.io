## **After two days of hard work**

Iâ€™ve finally set up my blog. Initially, I considered other blogging platforms like Tistory and Velog, but I found writing in Markdown and being able to directly tweak the blog theme code very appealing, so I chose GitHub.

I selected the [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) without much hesitation. Itâ€™s clean and neat, and it comes with many convenient features like dark mode. Although I faced several unexpected challenges, such as the layout: home # index page error, the missing gh-pages branch, and errors in the pages-deploy.yml file, I felt proud when I finally saw the blog page working correctly.

It seems that GitHub blogs are mainly used by developers to record what theyâ€™ve learned or newly discovered. Personally, I want mine to focus more on everyday content while subtly showcasing myself. It would be great if it could serve as both a personal record and a way to PR myself to others. I plan to diversify my blog categories to include topics derived from my studies, experiences, and thoughts.

I hope my blog becomes rich with content someday. For now, Iâ€™m excited to decorate it to my liking. ðŸ˜š

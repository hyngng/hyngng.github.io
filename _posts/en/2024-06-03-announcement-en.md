## **English pages aren't all set up**

I've recently added language support and am working hard on building out the pages in English. Currently, the language switcher and English support for the Home, Category, Tag, Archive, and About pages are complete, as well as functionality for sections like Recently Updated, Trending Tags, etc. to work with translated and English-written posts.

As I am doing all of this work on my own, it is a time-consuming process that requires a lot of effort. While I'm trying my best to review and refine the language based on my own understanding, the sheer volume of text means I have to rely on machine translation for a large portion of it. This may lead to some awkward phrasing or unnatural flow in the text.

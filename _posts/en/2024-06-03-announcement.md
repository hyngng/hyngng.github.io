## **English pages aren't all set up**

I've recently added language support and am working hard on building out the English pages.

Currently, the language switcher and English support for the HOME, CATEGORY, TAG, ARCHIVE, and ABOUT pages are complete, as well as functionality for sections like Recently Updated, Trending Tags, etc. to work with translated and English-written posts.

However, the English pages are still a work in progress and there may be some rough edges, including the search function. I appreciate your patience as I continue to improve the experience.

## **As I am not a native English speaker**

but someone who is a regular student with some English skills, the English version of the site is still a work in progress.

As I am doing all of this work on my own, it is a very time-consuming process that requires a lot of effort. While I'm trying my best to review and refine the language based on my own understanding, the sheer volume of text means I have to rely on machine translation for a large portion of it. This may lead to some awkward phrasing or unnatural flow in the text.

For the complete and intended experience, I recommend visiting the [Korean page](https://hynrng.github.io/) (or you can change the language at the sidebar) and utilize the translator.

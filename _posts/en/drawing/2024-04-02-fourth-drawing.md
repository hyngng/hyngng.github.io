These days, I've become obsessed with the audio brand Bang & Olufsen. Although I don't actually own any Bang & Olufsen products, the more I see the concept their products share and the philosophy the company espouses, the more I understand why Steve Jobs used to carry a photo of Bang & Olufsen products in his wallet when he was alive. Maybe I should carry a photo too.

Incidentally, as I've been drawing pictures periodically, I've felt that over time, my hands have become slower than when I first started drawing. But it seems like once I keep drawing, it quickly comes back to me. I wish I could draw more often, but it's not easy. 🥲

I’ve been trying to draw whenever I have some free time, but it’s harder than I thought because I always end up doing other things first. And honestly, only about half of the drawings I actually make are worth looking at. 🥲

But that distance, that space between wanting to draw and actually doing it, seems to help me look at my drawings in a fresh way every time. For example, I never considered things like image distortion or depth of field before, but I suddenly thought, “Why haven't I tried this?” and jumped right in. I usually just sketch quickly, but it's always refreshing to see the finished product.

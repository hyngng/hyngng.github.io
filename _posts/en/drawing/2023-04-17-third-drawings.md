This time, I wanted to try something new, so I played around with the compositional elements of the drawing in a interesting way. Personally, I’d love to be able to draw broadly and expansively like this. However, rather than focusing on elements like camera angle and colour that come into play during the execution of a piece, I’m more interested in exploring different art styles. In that sense, I’d like to try out watercolor, cel-shading, and doodle styles in the future.

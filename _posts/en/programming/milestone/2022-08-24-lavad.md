## **In Beginning**

I have a memory of being fascinated by [a youtuber(Tooner)](https://www.youtube.com/@tooner/videos) who implemented things like tank suspension, Picture-In-Picture scopes, and tracer effects in their videos when I was younger. The videos themselves were raw and rough, which is probably why they didn't have many views, but the content was really interesting.

Time passed, and while I was taking a break from everything, I thought of this YouTuber again. At a time when I wanted to create something with a computer, I rewatched this YouTuber's videos one by one, and I felt like I wanted to make things like that too. So, taking this YouTuber as a role model, I spent 2 weeks using Blender and Unity to create [my first milestone](https://hynrng.github.io/en/categories/milestone/).

## **Blender**

After going back and forth on what to create, I settled on the LAV-AD armored vehicle as my subject. Not only did this vehicle look cool, but since the body has a geometric shape, I thought it wouldn't be too difficult to model it directly.

Of course, at first I thought about getting a free model from the internet, but since most models are paid and I also wanted to try Blender, I decided to make it myself.

For basic shortcuts, I referred to well-organized posts online, and to get a feel for the Blender tool itself, I followed along with several speed modeling videos on YouTube channels abroad.

I noticed that in many cases, they were making models by referencing orthographic projection images from the X, Y, and Z axes. I also started gathering related materials from Google and began making my first model. Although there were difficulties, the process was quite systematic, so I was able to adapt quickly. As I worked on it, I was able to create a shape with my own unique feel.

## **Unity 3D**

Next was coding, and for this I also used Unity, which I had wanted to learn for a while. Looking back, it seems like I barely managed to make it through Unity, as I didn't know what to do or how to use it properly - it was like groping in the dark.

Since I had no foundation in object-oriented programming or component-based design, I searched not only domestic blog posts but also lectures by Indian YouTubers and old Stack Overflow questions.

Particularly when implementing the wheels, I used a Unity component called the Wheel Collider, but I couldn't find any relevant materials about it in Korean no matter how hard I looked. For the first time, I referred to the official Unity documentation, but it took me some time to use it properly due to my lack of understanding of the component itself.

However, this was the point where I started to enjoy Unity. When I finally got it working properly and saw the wheels rolling smoothly, I felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment.

## **Completion**

There were also many funny bugs. When I didn't know about the Wheel Collider, I tried to implement the vehicle movement with trigonometric functions, and it worked completely wrong. After applying the Wheel Collider, the wheel axles were misaligned, causing the wheels to roll in the wrong direction. Applying the newly modeled vehicle body caused issues with the mass value. While implementing the shell ejection effect, it was ejecting too many shells, and so on.

In addition to many bugs, basic syntax errors like missing semicolons or parentheses occurred frequently, causing more minor difficulties than expected. It was especially difficult around the time I applied the Wheel Collider.

Still, after going through 9 builds in total, I was able to create a satisfactory result. Incorporating my personal preferences and desires, I implemented depth of field post-processing effects for the camera, dust kicking up from the rear wheels during forward and reverse motion, and brighter rear lights when reversing, among other detailed touches, wrapping it up in an enjoyable way.

Starting on July 8th and completing the final build on July 25th, this was a short-term project completed in 17 days. Personally, while making the final build, I thought that I would like to undertake a larger project next time. There is also a regret that I wrote codes solely focused on achieving the goal without a proper understanding of C#.

Still, it was good to be able to experience a new paradigm, such as directly modeling or encountering the concept of object-oriented programming while writing code. Above all, I am pleased to have created a monument that I am attached to.

This past year, I’ve had a lot of fun experimenting with photography. I tried capturing the photos I wanted, as well as taking photos of other people. I even played around with different concepts for each photo, sometimes shooting from afar, sometimes close-up, sometimes emphasizing complementary colors, and sometimes even leaving the photos in black and white. It was always fascinating to see how the photos transformed under my fingertips, especially when I started playing with color grading and tone curves. I really enjoyed the process itself.

Thanks to that, I feel like I was able to create more unique photos than last year. However, I’ve started to feel a bit burdened by my tendency to approach all of my photos seriously and with a heavy heart. I’d like to detach myself from that technical obsession with photography from now on. That way, I can upload photos more casually, and I can also occasionally write down my experiences and thoughts related to photography.

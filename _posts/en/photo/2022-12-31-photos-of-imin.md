I enjoy how the feel of a photo changes over time, so I tend to take a lot of pictures in my daily life. This year, I got a new phone with a better camera, which made me curious, "Can I capture the same photos more beautifully than others?". The hardware of the latest models is so good that I wanted to make the most of it.

To take better photos, I looked up theories and browsed the photos that taken from other people, and it was truly fun and refreshing. As I kept exploring, I became more ambitious and ended up creating some photos that I wanted to keep. Although I have made some regrets, like editing JPGs causing the photos degrading, I’m more pleased that I’ve found a new way to document and express myself. I hope to post many great photos in the future.
